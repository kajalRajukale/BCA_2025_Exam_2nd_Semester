# Part 6: Control Flow - Loops

## Introduction to Loops

Loops are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They are essential for tasks that require repetition, such as processing arrays, reading input until a certain condition is met, or performing calculations iteratively. C provides several types of loops to handle different scenarios.

## while Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration.

### Syntax:

```c
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
    // as long as condition is true
}
```

### Example:

```c
int count = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
    printf("%d ", count);
    count++;
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

## do-while Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it checks the condition after executing the code block. This ensures that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

### Syntax:

```c
do {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
} while (condition);
```

### Example:

```c
int count = 1;
do {
    printf("%d ", count);
    count++;
} while (count <= 5);
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

## for Loop

The `for` loop provides a compact way to write loops that need initialization, condition checking, and incrementation/decrementation.

### Syntax:

```c
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
}
```

### Example:

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Nested Loops

Loops can be nested inside other loops, allowing for more complex iterations such as processing multi-dimensional arrays or generating patterns.

### Example:

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        printf("(%d,%d) ", i, j);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
// Output:
// (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
// (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
// (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)
```

## Loop Control Statements

### break Statement

The `break` statement terminates the loop and transfers control to the statement immediately following the loop.

### Example:

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 6) {
        break;  // Exit the loop when i equals 6
    }
    printf("%d ", i);
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

### continue Statement

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.

### Example:

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue;  // Skip even numbers
    }
    printf("%d ", i);
}
// Output: 1 3 5 7 9
```

## Infinite Loops

Loops that run indefinitely are called infinite loops. They can be created intentionally and are typically terminated using a `break` statement or by external interruption.

### Examples:

```c
// Infinite while loop
while (1) {
    // Code to be executed indefinitely
    // Use break to exit when necessary
}

// Infinite for loop
for (;;) {
    // Code to be executed indefinitely
    // Use break to exit when necessary
}
```

## Code Samples

### 1. Calculating Factorial using a while Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, i = 1;
    unsigned long long factorial = 1;

    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    if (num < 0) {
        printf("Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n");
    } else {
        while (i <= num) {
            factorial *= i;
            i++;
        }
        printf("Factorial of %d = %llu\n", num, factorial);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Sum of Digits using a do-while Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, remainder, sum = 0;

    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    do {
        remainder = num % 10;  // Get the last digit
        sum += remainder;      // Add to sum
        num /= 10;             // Remove the last digit
    } while (num != 0);

    printf("Sum of digits = %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Multiplication Table using a for Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, i;

    printf("Enter a number to display its multiplication table: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    printf("Multiplication table for %d:\n", num);

    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", num, i, num * i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Simple Pattern Printing using Nested Loops

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows, i, j;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    for (i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Using break and continue in Loops

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i;

    printf("Demonstrating break:\n");
    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i == 6) {
            printf("Breaking at i = %d\n", i);
            break;
        }
        printf("%d ", i);
    }

    printf("\n\nDemonstrating continue:\n");
    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            continue;  // Skip even numbers
        }
        printf("%d ", i);
    }

    printf("\n\nFinding first prime number after 10:\n");
    int num = 11;
    while (1) {
        int isPrime = 1;
        for (i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                isPrime = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isPrime) {
            printf("First prime after 10 is: %d\n", num);
            break;
        }
        num++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Exercises

1. Write a program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n, where n is entered by the user. Implement the solution using a while loop, a do-while loop, and a for loop.

2. Create a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms entered by the user. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).

3. Write a program that checks if a number entered by the user is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not divisible by any positive integer other than 1 and itself.

4. Create a program that prints a multiplication table grid for numbers 1 through 10. The output should be a 10x10 grid showing the products of each pair of numbers.

5. Write a program that reads integers from the user until a negative number is entered. Calculate and display the sum, average, maximum, and minimum of the entered positive numbers.

## Self-Assessment Questions

1. **What is the key difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?**

   - Answer: A while loop checks the condition before executing the code block, which means the code might never execute if the condition is initially false. A do-while loop checks the condition after executing the code block, ensuring that the code executes at least once.

2. **What are the three expressions in a for loop, and what do they do?**

   - Answer: The three expressions in a for loop are:
     - Initialization: Executes once before the loop starts, typically used to initialize a counter variable.
     - Condition: Checked before each iteration to determine if the loop should continue.
     - Update: Executes after each iteration, typically used to update the counter variable.

3. **What does the break statement do in a loop?**

   - Answer: The break statement terminates the loop and transfers control to the statement immediately following the loop, regardless of the loop's condition.

4. **What does the continue statement do in a loop?**

   - Answer: The continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.

5. **What is an infinite loop, and how can it be safely implemented?**
   - Answer: An infinite loop is a loop that runs indefinitely because its termination condition is never met. It can be safely implemented by using a while(1) or for(;;) construct along with a break statement inside the loop that provides a way to exit when a specific condition is met. It's important to ensure that the break condition can be reached to prevent the program from hanging.
