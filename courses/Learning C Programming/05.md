# Part 5: Control Flow - Conditional Statements

## Introduction to Control Flow
Control flow statements allow you to control the order in which statements in your program are executed. They enable your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on conditions. C provides several control flow statements to implement decision-making logic.

## if Statement
The `if` statement is the most basic control flow statement. It executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

### Syntax:
```c
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

### Example:
```c
if (age >= 18) {
    printf("You are eligible to vote.\n");
}
```

## if-else Statement
The `if-else` statement extends the `if` statement by providing an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.

### Syntax:
```c
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

### Example:
```c
if (age >= 18) {
    printf("You are eligible to vote.\n");
} else {
    printf("You are not eligible to vote yet.\n");
}
```

## if-else if-else Statement (Ladder)
You can chain multiple conditions using `if-else if-else` to check several conditions in sequence.

### Syntax:
```c
if (condition1) {
    // code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // code if condition3 is true
} else {
    // code if all conditions are false
}
```

### Example:
```c
if (score >= 90) {
    printf("Grade: A\n");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    printf("Grade: B\n");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    printf("Grade: C\n");
} else if (score >= 60) {
    printf("Grade: D\n");
} else {
    printf("Grade: F\n");
}
```

## Nested if Statements
You can place an `if` statement inside another `if` or `else` block to create nested conditionals.

### Syntax:
```c
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // code if both condition1 and condition2 are true
    } else {
        // code if condition1 is true but condition2 is false
    }
} else {
    // code if condition1 is false
}
```

### Example:
```c
if (age >= 18) {
    if (hasID) {
        printf("You can enter the venue.\n");
    } else {
        printf("You need to show ID to enter.\n");
    }
} else {
    printf("You must be 18 or older to enter.\n");
}
```

## switch Statement
The `switch` statement allows you to select one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of an expression.

### Syntax:
```c
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code if expression equals value2
        break;
    case value3:
        // code if expression equals value3
        break;
    default:
        // code if expression doesn't match any case
}
```

### Important points about switch:
- The `expression` must evaluate to an integer type (int, char, etc.)
- Each `case` must end with a `break` to prevent fall-through
- The `default` case is optional but recommended
- Multiple cases can share the same code block

### Example:
```c
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        printf("Monday\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday\n");
        break;
    case 4:
        printf("Thursday\n");
        break;
    case 5:
        printf("Friday\n");
        break;
    case 6:
        printf("Saturday\n");
        break;
    case 7:
        printf("Sunday\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid day\n");
}
```

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The conditional operator `?:` provides a shorthand way to write a simple `if-else` statement.

### Syntax:
```c
condition ? expression1 : expression2
```

This evaluates to `expression1` if the `condition` is true, and `expression2` if it's false.

### Example:
```c
result = (a > b) ? a : b;  // Sets result to the larger of a and b
```

## Code Samples

### 1. Basic if-else Statement
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    
    if (number > 0) {
        printf("%d is positive.\n", number);
    } else if (number < 0) {
        printf("%d is negative.\n", number);
    } else {
        printf("You entered zero.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Nested if Statement for Age and Height Requirements
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    float height;
    
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    
    printf("Enter your height in cm: ");
    scanf("%f", &height);
    
    printf("Status: ");
    
    if (age >= 13) {
        if (height >= 150.0) {
            printf("You can ride all attractions.\n");
        } else {
            printf("You can ride some attractions, but not the roller coaster.\n");
        }
    } else {
        if (height >= 120.0) {
            printf("You can ride children's attractions only.\n");
        } else {
            printf("Sorry, you cannot ride any attractions yet.\n");
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. switch Statement for Menu Selection
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int choice;
    
    printf("Calculator Menu:\n");
    printf("1. Addition\n");
    printf("2. Subtraction\n");
    printf("3. Multiplication\n");
    printf("4. Division\n");
    printf("Enter your choice (1-4): ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);
    
    int a, b;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    
    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, a + b);
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("%d - %d = %d\n", a, b, a - b);
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("%d * %d = %d\n", a, b, a * b);
            break;
        case 4:
            if (b != 0) {
                printf("%d / %d = %.2f\n", a, b, (float)a / b);
            } else {
                printf("Error: Division by zero!\n");
            }
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid choice!\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. Leap Year Determination
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int year;
    
    printf("Enter a year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);
    
    // A leap year is divisible by 4
    // But if it's divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400
    if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
        printf("%d is a leap year.\n", year);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a leap year.\n", year);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Conditional Operator Examples
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, max;
    
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    
    // Find maximum using conditional operator
    max = (a > b) ? a : b;
    printf("Maximum: %d\n", max);
    
    // Check if a number is even or odd
    printf("%d is %s\n", a, (a % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd");
    printf("%d is %s\n", b, (b % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd");
    
    // Absolute value using conditional operator
    int num, abs_num;
    printf("Enter a number to find its absolute value: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    
    abs_num = (num < 0) ? -num : num;
    printf("Absolute value of %d is %d\n", num, abs_num);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Exercises

1. Write a program that asks the user for their exam score (0-100) and prints the corresponding letter grade according to the following scale:
   - 90-100: A
   - 80-89: B
   - 70-79: C
   - 60-69: D
   - Below 60: F

2. Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. Test your program with various years like 1900, 2000, 2020, and 2100.

3. Write a program that acts as a simple calculator. It should ask the user for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), then perform the correct calculation and display the result. Use a switch statement for selecting the operation.

4. Create a program that determines if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene based on the lengths of its three sides. An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal, an isosceles triangle has exactly two sides equal, and a scalene triangle has all sides different.

5. Write a program that determines the quadrant or axis on which a point lies in a 2D coordinate system. Ask the user to enter the x and y coordinates of a point, then output whether the point is on:
   - The origin (0,0)
   - The x-axis (y = 0)
   - The y-axis (x = 0)
   - Quadrant I (x > 0, y > 0)
   - Quadrant II (x < 0, y > 0)
   - Quadrant III (x < 0, y < 0)
   - Quadrant IV (x > 0, y < 0)

## Self-Assessment Questions

1. **What is the purpose of the break statement in a switch case?**
   - Answer: The break statement exits the switch block. Without it, execution would continue to the next case, causing "fall-through" behavior.

2. **Can an if statement exist without an else statement?**
   - Answer: Yes, the else part is optional in an if statement.

3. **What happens if the condition in an if statement evaluates to zero?**
   - Answer: In C, zero is considered false, so the code block inside the if statement will not execute.

4. **What are the values that are considered false in C?**
   - Answer: In C, only the value 0 (zero) is considered false. All other values (including negative numbers) are considered true.

5. **What is the maximum number of else-if statements you can have in an if-else chain?**
   - Answer: There is no practical limit. You can have as many else-if statements as needed, but for better readability and performance, a switch statement might be preferable for many conditions.
